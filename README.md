## Motivation
This work is an extension of [our WSDM 2019 paper](https://dgliu.github.io/paper/wsdm19_spiral_of_silence.pdf). The new contents we have added include:

1. Add new empirical study by considering five possible definitions of the majority opinion.
2. Add three new models that mimic different components of the spiral of silence, i.e. MCO, MCC and MCM model.
3. Add new dataset and experiment results, i.e. Coat shopping dataset and Parameter Influence.
4. Other improvements that have been made throughout the whole paper.

## Dataset
We don't upload the dataset file because the size is too large. You can get the dataset in the following two ways:

1. Get the raw data from the Internet and modify it to the format we used in the experiment: `user, item, rating, timestamp, current average, rating distribution`
2. Request directly from us
